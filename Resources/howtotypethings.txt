TokenIDE is designed to allow you to type most things in with a standard keyboard.
However, it also pretty prints characters as it reads them in, and as you type.
Because of this it can be hard to know what to type to get a specific character.
The reference pane on the left can be very helpful, but here are a few of the most
commonly asked after characters:

The "Sto" arrow (→): ->
The negative sign (⁻): ~
The tilde sign (~): |~
The "squared" symbol (²): ^^2
	(Note: try ^^CHARACTER for other super-script characters, such as "sin⁻¹(")
The "pi" symbol (π): pi
	(Note: try this for other Greek characters as well, such as theta)
The actual string "pi", for example, if you're typing "typing": \pi
	(Note: this is true for all special symbols, e.g. \mu to type the literal string "mu")
The backslash character: \\
The small L for lists (ʟ): |L
Y= vars (such as Y₁): {Y1}
R►Pr(: R>Pr(
	(Note: when the token has ►, try >)
Mathematical symbols, such as √(: sqrt(

These are some of the most commonly asked-after tokens, and how they can be typed with
the default Tokens files. Note that if you are using a custom file not released with
TokenIDE, you can look in the reference pane or the .XML file.
